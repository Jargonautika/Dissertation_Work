Select "Set "bt", "bH", and "p"..." to define the following parameters:

(a) Talking Level, beta_T
"The talking level is an over-all measure of the acoustic level and is
here defined to be the long-time average intensity level of speech at a
point one meter directly in front of the talker's lips in a free acoustic
field and is designated beta_T. The long-time average intensity is the
average taken over a length of time sufficient to include the typical
pauses between syllables and words" (Fletcher 1953, p. 313). Its default
value is 68 dB SPL.

(b) Hearing Loss for Speech, beta_H
This value is normally calculated from the Audiogram. Many of Fletcher's
subjects had audiograms that yielded beta_H = -4 dB. For ease of comparison
between Fletcher's pencil-and-paper calculations of the AI and the calculations
with this software, the user is given the option to specify beta_H directly.
  
(c) Proficiency Factor, p
A scaling factor, p, which ranges between 0 and 1, is used to account
for the test-taking proficiency of the talker-listener pair. The default
value of the proficiency factor, p, is unity.
