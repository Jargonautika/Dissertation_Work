Calculate AI:

After the desired system response, masker spectrum, and audiogram
have been selected, select "CALCULATE NOW" from the "Fletcher AI" menu
to initiate the AI calculation. The AI is plotted as a function of the
gain alpha of an amplifier that delivers the speech signal to the
filter. The values for the talking level and the hearing loss for speech
that were used in the calculation are displayed in the upper left corner
of the plot. The filenames of the response, masker, and audiogram used
are displayed in the title line of the plot.

Display Intelligibility vs Gain Function:

Select "Display CVC Score vs Gain" or "Display Phoneme Score vs Gain" 
from the "Fletcher AI" menu to generate performance-intensity functions
(PI functions). The predictions of the intelligibility scores are
derived from the predicted AIs by the transformations given in Fig.
179 on p. 301 of Fletcher 1953. 

Save Results:

Select "Save Data" form the "Save" menu to save the AI-vs-Gain 
function or the Intelligibility-vs-Gain functions of the current
plot as text files. The saved files contain two columns. The first
column holds gain values and the second column contains the corresponding
AI values or intelligibility scores.
