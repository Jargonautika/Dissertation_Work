The use of main function: GPoim
============================================
gpoim = GPoim(s, n, fs, s_o, prtLevel) 

This MATLAB implementation computes the normalised estimate of the number of above-threshold 
speech target regions represented at the level of the auditory nerve.

input:
        s           input speech signal
        n           input noise signal
        fs          sampling frequency, Hz
        s_o         unmodified form of s. This argument only takes effect if s differs from 
        			s_o in duration
        prtLevel    presentation level of s+n mixture, SPL [default: 74 dB SPL]

output:
        gpoim       index of glimpsing metric
        gp          original glimpse proportion in Cooke (2006)

 usage:
 		To compute intelligibility index of a speech signal in presence of a given noise 
 		signal: 
        [gpoim, gp] = GPoim(speech, noise, fs)
        
        To compute intelligibility index of a modified signal which differs from the original
        unmodified signal in duration: 
        [gpoim, gp] = GPoim(modified, noise, fs, unmodified)
        
        To compute intelligibility index of a speech signal in presence of a given noise 
 		signal, with the presentation level of speech+noise mixture in dB SPL known:
        [gpoim, gp] = GPoim(modified, noise, fs, unmodified, 63)
